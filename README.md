Here I will keep my study about C++
Introduction to Classes Objects and String
*	This document as to make introction for to create
and define class.
* 	How to implement a class attributes as data members
* 	How to call a member function of an object to perform a taks;
* 	The diffrences between data members of a class and local variables of a function
* 	How to use a constructor to initialize an object's data when the object is created.
*	How to engineer a class to separate ist interface from its implementation and encourage reuse.
*	How to use objects of class string.	

In this chapter, your created user-defined class. and created and used objects of those classes. We declared data members
of a classto maintain data for each object of the class. We also defined member functions that operate on that data. You 
learned hom to call an object's member function to request the services the object provides and hom to pass data to those member functions as arguments. We discussed the difference between a local variable of a member function and a data member of a class. We also showed how to use a constructor to specify initial values foran object's data members. You learned how to separate the interface of a class from its implementation to promote good software engineering. We presented a diagram that shows the files that class-implementation programmers and client-code programmers need to compile the code they write. We demostrated how set functions can be used to validate an object's data and ensure that objects are maintained in a consistent state. Uml class diagrams were used to model classes and their constructors, member function and data members.
